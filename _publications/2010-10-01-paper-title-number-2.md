We present a novel morphing technique to generate pleasing visual effects between 2 topologically varying trees while preserving the topological consistency and botanical meanings of any in-between shapes as natural trees. Specifically, we first efficiently convert leafy trees into botanically inspired chain-lobe representations in an automatic way. With the aid of branching-pattern aware, one-to-many correspondences between branches and leaves, we hierarchically interpolate branches of in-between trees while maintaining their topological consistencies. Finally, we simultaneously interpolate foliage, specifically every single leaf, during the morphing process, avoiding the generation of unpleasant <i>floating</i> leaves. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by creating visually compelling tree morphing animations, even between cross-species.
