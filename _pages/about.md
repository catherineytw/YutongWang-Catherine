I earned my doctorate from the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG at the School of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, where I focused on computer graphics. My research was particularly deep and robust in areas such as three-dimensional geometric model processing, sketch-based interactive modeling, data-driven generation of diverse 3D models with intelligence, and skeletal-driven 3D animation. During my academic tenure, I was honored twice with the title of Zhejiang University Outstanding Graduate Student, received the first prize in the ARM Innovation Scholarship, and was awarded the Lu Zengyong Scholarship (third prize). I have published four academic papers as the first author, including an article in TVCG (a top-tier CCF-A journal) and two best paper awards at CASA conferences (CCF-C category). Furthermore, I have obtained two patents and registered three software copyrights.
