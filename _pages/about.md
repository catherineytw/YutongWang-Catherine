Biography
======
On June 2018, I graduated from the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG at the Computer Science Department, Zhejiang University. I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Xiaogang Jin and received a doctorate in Computer Science, with a specialization in computer graphics. My research interests are Computer Graphics, Animation and Computer Vision.  
As a PHD Candidate, I was honored twice with the title of Zhejiang University Outstanding Graduate Student, received the first prize in the ARM Innovation Scholarship, and was awarded the Lu Zengyong Scholarship (third prize). I have published four academic papers as the first author, including an article in TVCG (a top-tier CCF-A journal) and two best paper awards at CASA conferences (CCF-C category). Furthermore, I have obtained two patents and registered three software copyrights.
