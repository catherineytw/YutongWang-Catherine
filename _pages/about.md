Biography
======
On June 2018, I graduated from the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG at the Computer Science Department, Zhejiang University. I was fortunate to be advised by [Professor Xiaogang Jin](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/jin/) and received a doctorate in Computer Science, with a specialization in <b>Computer Graphics</b>. My research interests are <b>Computer Graphics</b>, <b>Animation</b> and <b>Computer Vision</b>.  

As a PHD candidate, I was honored twice with the title of Zhejiang University Outstanding Graduate Student, received the first prize in the ARM Innovation Scholarship, and was awarded the Lu Zengyong Scholarship (third prize). I have published four academic papers as the first author, including an article in TVCG (a top-tier CCF-A journal) and two best paper awards at CASA conferences (CCF-C category). Furthermore, I have obtained two patents and registered three software copyrights.
